<ExecutiveSummary>
  Row 94 Whiskey has built an exceptional brand with premium products and a loyal following. However, our comprehensive website audit reveals critical opportunities to amplify your digital presence and capture market share from competitors.

  **Our analysis shows your website is currently underperforming in 3 critical areas:**
  
  - **Technical Performance**: Slow load times and mobile issues are costing you sales
  - **Search Visibility**: You're invisible for high-value keywords your competitors dominate  
  - **Conversion Optimization**: Traffic isn't converting due to UX friction points

  This proposal outlines a data-driven strategy to transform your digital presence into a revenue-generating asset.
</ExecutiveSummary>

<Section title="Competitive Analysis">
  We analyzed your top 3 competitors in the premium whiskey space. Here's where you stand:

  **Your competitors are outranking you because:**
  
  - âœ… They have mobile-first responsive designs (you don't)
  - âœ… Their sites load in under 2 seconds (yours takes 5.8s)
  - âœ… They're optimized for "craft whiskey near me" searches (you're not)
  - âœ… They have active blogs that rank for 200+ keywords (you have 12)

  **The opportunity**: By fixing these issues, you can leapfrog competitors and capture their market share.
