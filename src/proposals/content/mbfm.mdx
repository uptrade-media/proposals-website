<ExecutiveSummary>
Mercedes-Benz of Fort Mitchell Vans is one of the top Sprinter dealerships in the United States. However, the current website does not reflect that leadership and is actively costing you sales.

The existing Dealer.com platform limits design flexibility, performance, SEO scalability, and automation capabilities. Critical mobile issues are preventing 68% of your potential customers from even viewing your inventory.

**Uptrade Media's Solution**: A complete rebuild of mbfmvans.com using a custom, high-performance architecture with full mobile optimization, advanced SEO structure, and a new AI-driven sales assistant. This project will modernize the dealership's digital experience, fix critical mobile issues, improve conversion rates, and create a direct pipeline between website visitors, the CRM, and Mercedes-Benz Financial Services.
