<ExecutiveSummary>
Row 94 Whiskey already carries the storytelling and credibility of a national brand through its partnership with Dierks Bentley. However, the current digital infrastructure is not converting this recognition into recurring revenue at its full potential.

Our mission is to make Row 94 discoverable, compliant, and conversion-focused through data-driven optimization and smart API integrations that automate compliance, personalize experiences, and boost revenue within weeks.

## How Row 94 Compares to Leading Whiskey Brands

### Current Performance Snapshot

| Brand | Monthly Organic Traffic | Keywords Ranking | Authority Score | Market Position |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Row 94 Whiskey** | 557 (-1% change) | 173 (77% branded only) | 25 (Needs work) | **Underperforming** |
| **Calumet Bourbon** | 8,400 (15x Row 94) | 1,500 (8.7x Row 94) | 28 (Solid foundation) | **Dominant** |
| **Augusta Distillery** | 3,000 (5.4x Row 94) | 381 (2.2x Row 94) | 29 (Strong foundation) | **Competitive** |
| **Brother Justus** | 2,600 (4.7x Row 94) | 697 (4x Row 94) | 27 (Adequate base) | **Opportunity Gap** |

### Key Insights

**Market Opportunity**: Row 94 has significant room for growth. Even reaching 25% of Calumet's traffic would mean **2,100 monthly visitors** - a 377% increase from current levels.

**Competitive Advantage**: Brother Justus shows that even with good traffic (2.6k), poor UX leaves sales on the table. Row 94's celebrity partnership + optimized experience = market disruption potential.
